11.3 Using super keyword

    this -> references calling object
    super -> refers to superlass of the class in which super appears

    Used for:
        * calling superclass constructor
        * call superclass method

    super() -> no-arg constructor
    super(parameters) invokes superclass constructor that matches the param/args.

    super(color, filled) -> instead of calling the setter methods

    super() is automatically the first statemnet in constructor if no constructor is invoked.

    Constructor chaining: subclass constructor invokes its superclass constructor, and if
        superclass is derived from another class, will invoke superclass constructor before
        performing it's own tasks.
